# What is AjaxableJS
AjaxableJS is a small javascript library that helps you to quickly ajaxify your HTML dom elements on certain events for e.g. click, hover, submit, timeout, interval etc. Traditionally, firing ajax requests on dom events is a tedious task as you have to include jQuery or use native XMLHTTPRequest and write a lot of boilerplate code just to fire a GET ajax request. With ajaxableJS you can declaratively define your ajax params on the element itself and instantiate ajaxableJS on it.

BTW, the library does much more than just firing ajax requests. You can show the overlay loading on whole screen or particular div element, show 3 types of notifications (Sweetalert, Toastr or bootstrap alert) based on your ajax response, replace inner contents of a div with ajax response, reload/redirect window after certain timeout etc.
